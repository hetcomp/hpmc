/** Field for sampling an existing OpenGL 3D texture.
 *
 * If gradients is true, the field is assumed to have four components, where the
 * rgb-channels encode the gradient while the a-channel encode the scalar field.
 *
 * If gradients is false, gradients are found on the fly using forward
 * differences. If the target is pre-OpenGL 3.0, the field is assumed to reside
 * in the alpha-channel, while for targets from OpenGL 3.0 and up, the field is
 * assumed to reside in the red channel. The reason for this is compatibility,
 * early OpenGL 2.0 vertex shaders could only fetch from either float RGBA or A
 * textures in the vertex shaders, while with OpenGL 3.0, single channeled
 * textures should reside in the red channel.
 *
 * It is the developer's responsibility that the texture exists and maintains
 * its dimensions throughout the lifetime of this object. However, the actual
 * contents may be changed dynamically.
